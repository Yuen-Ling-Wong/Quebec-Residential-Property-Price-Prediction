# Quebec-Residential-Property-Price-Prediction

This project aims at analyzing the latest data regarding real-estates in Québec and building machine learnning models that can predict property prices in Québec.

In this project, I have scraped the lastest data from: <br>

## Questions to be Explored:
1. The Distribution of Prices of Properties in Quebec
2. The Proportion of Each Type of Properties in Quebec
3. The Important Features on PRedicting the Price
4. Builing Residential Property Price Prediction Models
